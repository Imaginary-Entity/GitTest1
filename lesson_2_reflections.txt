What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A Git file is started. But no commits are entered until I enter one.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a mid way hidden file area where you can assess which files will make it into the commit before you actually have to commit.
