When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating or when you'd like someone else to check over your wok.
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    For the same reason that Git doesn't commit automatically, the code might not be ready yet! :O

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Clones copy and paste a repo and it's history to another computer or folder, used when you want to edit someone elses code or work on a project that isn't on the computer you're on. Forks are clones that are done all on GitHub's servers, used when you want to use someone elses project on GitHub and copy it to your own GitHub profile where you can also get collaborators to work with you on it. Branches are a list of Git Logs associated with different 'heads' in a repo, used when you want to make changes or add a feature etc. to a project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
